    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Cameron, and I’m currently studying Accounting at BYU-Idaho. I’m excited about learning how to build beautiful and functional websites that can make a difference.</p>

    <p>I’ve always been fascinated by technology, and this course is a step toward my goal of becoming a better web developer. I hope to use what I learn here to help others and potentially start a freelance business in the future.</p>

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>Outside of school, I enjoy playing basketball, hunting, fishing, and spending time with family.</p>

    <h2>Why BYU-Idaho?</h2>
    <p>I love the spirit and focus of BYU-Idaho. The Christ-centered learning environment really helps me stay motivated and grounded.</p>

    <h2>Favorite Scripture</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite scriptures is Proverbs 3:5–6: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”</p>
