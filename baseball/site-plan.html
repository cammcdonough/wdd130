      <h3>About Baseball</h3>
      <p>Baseball is more than just a sport—it's a piece of American history. This section introduces readers to the game, starting with its origins in the 1800s and tracing its growth into one of the most iconic sports around the world. It will explain what makes baseball different from other sports: its slower pace, strategic depth, and cultural impact.</p>
      <p>Whether you're a brand new fan or a young athlete considering playing, this page gives you a friendly welcome into the world of baseball. You'll learn how the game is played, how it's enjoyed by millions, and why it continues to be a pastime for all ages. Readers will also see how baseball connects communities, creates friendships, and promotes teamwork and discipline.</p>

      <h3>Rules & Basics</h3>
      <p>This page is designed to help visitors understand the basics of how the game is played. It explains the roles of the offensive and defensive teams, how a game progresses through nine innings, and how scoring works. Readers will learn the meaning of balls, strikes, outs, runs, and other fundamental terms used in every game.</p>
      <p>Additionally, it will answer questions like: What is a strike zone? How does a batter get out? What happens after someone hits the ball? Visitors will walk away with enough knowledge to watch or play a game with confidence. This is the page for people who are tired of asking “What just happened?” during a baseball game.</p>

      <h3>Player Positions</h3>
      <p>Baseball has nine defensive positions on the field. This page breaks down each position—from the pitcher on the mound to the outfielders in the grass—and describes what each one does. It helps readers understand how all positions work together to stop the other team from scoring.</p>
      <p>The page also covers batting order roles, such as lead-off hitters, cleanup hitters, and pinch hitters. By combining diagrams and easy-to-understand explanations, this page helps new players decide which positions they may want to try and helps fans identify what each player is doing on the field.</p>
