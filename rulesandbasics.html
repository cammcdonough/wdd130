        <h2>How the Game Works</h2>
        <p>
          Baseball is played between two teams of nine players. Each team takes turns
          batting and fielding. The batting team tries to score runs by hitting the
          ball and safely reaching each base in order: first, second, third, and home.
        </p>
        <p>
          A standard game has nine innings. In each inning, both teams bat once. The
          fielding team tries to record three outs by striking batters out, catching
          balls in the air, or throwing runners out at the bases.
        </p>

        <h3>Basic Rules to Know</h3>
        <ul class="rules-list">
          <li>Four balls equals a walk to first base.</li>
          <li>Three strikes equals an out.</li>
          <li>Fair balls are hit inside the foul lines; others are foul.</li>
          <li>Runners must touch each base in order to score a run.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Balls, Strikes, and Outs</h3>
        <p>
          When a batter is at the plate, the umpire calls balls and strikes based on
          where the pitch crosses the strike zone. Foul balls usually count as strikes,
          but a foul ball cannot be strike three unless it is a bunt attempt.

        <h3>Quick Game Facts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>9 innings in a standard game</li>
          <li>3 outs per half-inning</li>
          <li>9 defensive players on the field</li>
          <li>Home team bats second</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Learning just a few core rules makes it much easier to follow what is happening
          during a game. Once you understand outs, innings, and how runs are scored,
          everything else starts to make more sense.
